# Playstore Scraper and Downloader
---

The scraper collects metadata for top free listing from each category. The playstore lists only 540 apps in each list.

## Resources
1. [Google Play Scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper): A Nodejs server that makes request to the official Google Play API and retrieves meta-data for the apps.
2. [Gplaycli](https://github.com/matlink/gplaycli): We used a slightly modified version of this CLI (repurposed as a Python package). Requires only a package name to download the APK file if the app is free.
3. [PlayDrone](https://github.com/nviennot/playdrone): The publicly available dataset from this project provides a list of about 1.4M+ apps (1.1M+ free apps).
